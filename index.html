          <p>Fish are the gill-bearing aquatic craniate animals that lack limbs with digits. They form a sister group to the tunicates, together forming
            the olfactores. Included in this definition are the living hagfish, lampreys, and cartilaginous and bony fish as well as various extinct 
            related groups. Tetrapods emerged within lobe-finned fishes, so cladistically they are fish as well.</p>

            <p>Birds (Aves) are a group of endothermic vertebrates, characterised by feathers, toothless beaked jaws, the laying of hard-shelled eggs,
              a high metabolic rate, a four-chambered heart, and a strong yet lightweight skeleton. Birds live worldwide and range in size from the 5 cm
              (2 in) bee hummingbird to the 2.75 m (9 ft) ostrich.</p>

              <p>Mammals are any vertebrates within the class Mammalia (/məˈmeɪliə/ from Latin mamma "breast"), a clade of endothermic amniotes distinguished
                from reptiles (including birds) by the possession of a neocortex (a region of the brain), hair, three middle ear bones, and mammary glands.
                Females of all mammal species nurse their young with milk, secreted from the mammary glands.
                Mammals include the biggest animals on the planet, the great whales. </p>

          <div class="article-reptile">
            <p>Reptiles are tetrapod animals in the class Reptilia, comprising today's turtles, crocodilians, snakes, amphisbaenians, lizards, tuatara, and their
              extinct relatives. The study of these traditional reptile orders, historically combined with that of modern amphibians, is called herpetology.
              Because some reptiles are more closely related to birds than they are to other reptiles (e.g., crocodiles are more closely related to birds than they
              are to lizards), the traditional groups of "reptiles" listed above do not together constitute a monophyletic grouping (or clade).</p>

            <p>Amphibians are ectothermic, tetrapod vertebrates of the class Amphibia. Modern amphibians are all Lissamphibia. They inhabit a wide variety of habitats,
              with most species living within terrestrial, fossorial, arboreal or freshwater aquatic ecosystems. Thus amphibians typically start out as larvae living 
              in water, but some species have developed behavioural adaptations to bypass this.</p>
